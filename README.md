## Overview

<img src="thumbnail.jpg" />

While DevChallenges is an amazing resource, I felt it was best to solidify the fundamentals before diving into more complex Flexbox/Grid projects.

Over the last month, I completed <a href="http://freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">Free Code Camp</a>'s HTML/CSS trainings. . I'm SO glad I took a step back—now I have a much deeper understanding of responsive design and accessibility best practices.

After all that prep, this challenge felt like a breeze! I highly recommend checking out their <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/" target="_blank">Full Stack Developer Curriculum</a>.  

### What I learned

It took me a moment to see exactly how grid came into play—I imagine that just comes with practice. 

At first, I tried using checkmark bullet points via list-style images, but I couldn’t center them since they weren’t square. I ended up switching to ::before and Flexbox, and everything snapped into place much more easily.
